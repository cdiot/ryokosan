                    I realized that it is sometimes difficult to find people around you with the same availability as you. Not finding a platform to my liking, I
                    created ryokosan, a human platform that shares the co-travel putting the profiles of each one forward, as much as the destination.</target>

                <target>Ryokosan is a European platform that allows you to meet other people regardless of their nationality with the same desires as you In terms of travel and activities. Our concept is halfway between a social network
                    and a dating site, in fact it makes it possible to match profiles according to their destinations, geolocation, interest, age, gender,
                    which is still more efficient than a forum where you post a little of everything and anything. Ryokosan is also a free site, without 
                    any subscription where each profile is verified and we will not influence you to sell you organized trips, you are free. You can browse
                    quietly without advertising and your data belongs to you, you keep them! The team is young between 19 and 26 years old, dynamic and 
                    active on the networks. Co-traveling is a way of traveling that has existed for millennia, we are not going to pretend to reinvent the
                    wheel, but we hope to bring you directly to your goal.</target>
